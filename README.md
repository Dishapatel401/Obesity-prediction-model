**Obesity Prediction model**

**Objective:** The dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive study and visualization of the multifaceted factors associated with obesity, through an intuitive interface, users can explore and analyze the intricate relationships between various variables influencing obesity trends.

**Analysis:** Various plots are used to visualize the relationship between various factors affecting obesity 

**Result:** The multiple R-squared value is 0.9823, suggesting that weight and height together explain approximately 98.23% of the variance in BMI.
The adjusted R-squared value is 0.9822, which adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. The F-statistic is very large (2.207e+04) with a very small p-value (< 2.2e-16), indicating that the overall model is highly significant.

**Manegerial Implication:** Overall, the model suggests that weight and height are strong predictors of BMI, with each contributing significantly to the model's predictive power. The high R-squared value indicates that the model fits the data well. However, it's important to note that while weight and height are important predictors, there may be other factors not included in the model that also influence BMI.
